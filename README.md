# Health-Care-Analysis
In this project, I analyzed workforce shift data using Power BI to uncover key trends, operational inefficiencies, and financial insights. The dataset included details on shift schedules, worker assignments, workplace locations, timestamps for shift creation and claims, as well as financial metrics such as pay rates and charge rates. By visualizing patterns in shift durations, cancellations, and worker participation, I identified areas for optimization in workforce management. Additionally, I dove into the financial impact of pay and charge rates to assess profitability and cost efficiency. This analysis provided insights as for how to improve scheduling, enhance employee retention, and optimize financial standing.
